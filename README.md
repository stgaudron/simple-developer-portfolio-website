## Portfolio Website For Developers with Typescript ðŸ’¯

Converted to typescript from [Manu Arora PortFolio Website for Developers](https://github.com/manuarora700/simple-developer-portfolio-website)

Typescript settings are very permissive, this is meant to be a starting point, for a personnal site.

File structure was modified to match NextJs Typescript style, jsconfig.json was commented but left there for reference.
